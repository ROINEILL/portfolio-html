<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm Roineill Genove, turning 18 this august 2, and currently taking a course of computer science in LORMA COLLGES as i want to expand my skills
  and to get more knowledge about the technology that aline this generation. I graduated in Naguilian National High School-Senior High School as a 
  STEM student. There are to many challenges that i've been face during Senior High School life but in my opinion there is no easy life. My hobbies 
  are watching on Tiktok, Instagram, facebook, also playing games that relieve me from stress.</p>

<p>What i can say about myself is i have a strong dignity that will help me to overcome challenges. I like also to explore things such as opening 
  some sites/links and make some fun stuff that also relieve me from stress. It's a good thing that i want to explore things because i want also 
  to step forward to my comfort zone since there are to many oppurtunities out there to explore things that will help me to accomplish that i don't
  know.</p>

<p>I'm looking forward to gain more experience as i move forward to my comfort zone.</p>
